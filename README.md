Adventure Game
This project is an interactive, text-based adventure game built in Python. The player will navigate through different scenarios by making choices, each leading to different outcomes. The goal is to make the right choices to win the game.

How It Works
Game Start: When the game begins, the player is prompted to enter their name, and they receive a welcome message.
Choosing Directions: The player starts on a dirt road and must decide to go either left or right.
Left:
If the player chooses to go left, they encounter a river. They can choose to walk around it or swim across.
Swimming results in being eaten by an alligator, ending the game.
Walking results in running out of water, which also ends the game.
Right:
If the player chooses right, they come across a wobbly bridge and can choose to cross it or go back.
Going back ends the game.
Crossing the bridge lets them meet a stranger.
They can either talk to the stranger, which wins them the game with a reward of gold, or ignore them, which offends the stranger and ends the game.
Winning and Losing:
There are multiple losing paths but only one winning outcome: going right, crossing the bridge, and talking to the stranger.
